Always use tailwind to style the app.
Use hover states to indicate interactive elements.
Never use drop shadows, gradients, or animations.

---

Use function components with hooks.

```tsx
interface ReactComponentProps {
  name: string;
}

export default function ReactComponent(props: ReactComponentProps) {
  return <h1>Hallo {props.name}.</h1>;
}
```

---

Separate UI components from business logic.
For each tool, create a main React function component for the UI.
Place the core logic (heavy lifting) in separate TypeScript functions or modules within the tool's directory (e.g., `toolLogic.ts`).

---

You should always fix typos, grammar, and spelling mistakes.
Sentences start with a capital letter and end with a period.

---

Run the test to make sure the code is working as expected.

```npm
npm test run
```

This is using vitest and the run will make it do a single run of the tests instead of watching the files.

---

Make sure to update the documentation if you change the code.

This includes updating:

- The general README file in the root of the project.
- The README file of the tool you are working on.
- The style guide if you change the style of the app.

---

The name of the site is `The Right Tool` and the domain is `therighttool.dev`.
The name should always be written in title case.

The tagline is `Why use the wrong tool when you can use the right one?`.

---

If you want to use icons then you should use the `react-icons` package.
