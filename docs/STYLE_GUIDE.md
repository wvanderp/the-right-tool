# The Right Tool - Design Language

## Brand Colors & Theme

Our primary color is a warm yellow (#CA8A04) that brings energy and optimism to the interface. We use it for important actions and highlights.

The app uses a clean, modern color scheme:

- Main content areas: White background for clarity
- Navigation and cards: A subtle light gray (#F9FAFB) or dark gray (#1F2937) background
- Text comes in three shades:
  - Main text: Deep gray, almost black (#111827)
  - Secondary information: Medium gray (#4B5563)
  - Subtle text: Light gray (#6B7280)

## Typography & Text

We keep things simple with a clean, modern system font. Text should be easy to read:

- Base size is 16px
- Comfortable line height of 1.5
- We use three weights: normal (400), medium (500), and bold (700) for hierarchy

## Layout & Spacing

We use a 4px grid system for consistency. Common spacing values are:

- Tiny details: 8px
- Standard spacing: 16px
- Comfortable breathing room: 24px
- Section separation: 32px
- Major divisions: 48px

Content is centered and has a max-width of 1152px to ensure readability.

## Interactive Elements

### Buttons & Links

Buttons should feel satisfying to click:

- Default state: Our yellow primary color with white text
- Hover: Slightly darker for feedback
- Click: Even darker to feel responsive

Links use our yellow color and get an underline on hover.

### Navigation & Structure

The navigation menu and footer use a sophisticated dark gray background (#1F2937) with:

- Active items highlighted in yellow
- Subtle hover effects
- Clean white text for contrast

### Forms & Input

Form elements should feel precise and responsive:

- Text inputs have light borders that highlight on focus
- Code areas use a monospace font
- Upload areas have dashed borders
- Sliders use our yellow accent color

### Tool Components

Tools are presented in clean, white cards with:

- Subtle borders
- Light hover effects
- Clear headings
- Comfortable padding

### Feedback & States

We communicate clearly with users:

- Errors: Soft red backgrounds with clear messages
- Success: Gentle green confirmation
- Loading: Subtle opacity changes with spinners
- Disabled states: Reduced opacity

### Code Display

Code is shown in:

- Light gray or dark backgrounds
- Monospace font
- Comfortable padding
- Scrollable when needed

All interactions should have smooth transitions (200ms) to feel polished but snappy.
