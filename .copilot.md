always use tailwind to style the app.
Use hover states to indicate interactive elements.
No drop shadows, gradients, or animations.

use function components with hooks

```tsx
interface ReactComponentProps {
    name: string
}

export default function ReactComponent(props : ReactComponentProps){
    return (
        <h1>Hallo {props.name}</h1>
    )
}
```

you should always fix typos, grammar, and spelling mistakes
sentences start with a capital letter and end with a period.

Run the test to make sure the code is working as expected.
```npm
npm test run
```
