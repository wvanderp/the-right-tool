# Day list

Sometimes you need a list of days of a certain type. This tool will help you generate that list.

for example, you can generate a Saturdays in a year.
or every 20th of the month in a year.

## History

I needed a list of all the Saturdays in a year for a project. 

## Decisions


## Future improvements

we should start by having all the days in a certain range and then we can start applying filters to that list. like filtering by day of the week or by the day of the month.

filters can include:

- day of the week
- day numbers of the month
- day numbers of the year
- week numbers of the year
- week numbers of the month

an other thing we can customize is the output format. like the date format or the separator between the dates or the language of the names of the days and months.
